A Discord bot for spicing up your voice channel entry with random jingles, 
custom member "theme songs" and more.

## 1. About
Jingler is a Discord bot for playing short, usually random, audio clips (also called [jingles](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jingle)).

The list of available jingles is currently global and each user can upload their own short jingles, which will in turn also be available
to every other user and server. By default, Jingler will play a random jingle each time a member joins a voice channel.

Each server has some configuration options: they can disable the automatic jingles (manually playing them with `.playrandom` will still be available),
they can set a specific jingle for their server or configure Jingler to always play a random, fresh jingle (best option ðŸ˜‰ ).

To spice things up, each user can set their own favourite jingle - a "theme song" of sorts. Unless automatic jingles are disabled on that server,
their theme song will be played each time they join a voice channel.

# 3. Installation
Currently, I don't run Jingler as a public bot that you could just add to your server.
However, that does not mean that you can't run your own!
Grab a person familiar with setting up Python and/or Discord bots and let's go!

- First make sure you have [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/) installed. Then, follow the instructions on [installing Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation), a Python package manager.
- When both Python and Poetry are installed, [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) or download the Jingler repository
and store or extract it into a directory of your choosing.
- Install dependencies by running `poetry install`.
- Copy `data/configuration.EXAMPLE.toml` to `data/configuration.toml` and fill out the bot token and server whitelist.
- Start the bot by running `poetry run python jingle_bot.py` or by using `run.sh` (needs `screen` installed) or `run.ps1`.
- And that's it! Enjoy!

If you encounter bugs or have feature ideas (that I may or may not implement), feel free open an [`Issue`](https://github.com/DefaultSimon/jingler/issues).
